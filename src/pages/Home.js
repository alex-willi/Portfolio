      I'm a software engineer currently attending the General Assembly coding
      bootcamp. Looking forward to getting out there to start freelancing and
      building my portfolio with fun creative projects . I was self employed in
      home construction and social media marketing, so I know how to deliver
      what a person is looking for. I decided to pivot because I am interested
      in the possibilities of software development.
